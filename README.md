An IDE in Python for Python

Description
------------

This is a very simple IDE for Python. It allows you to create, edit, save and run scripts (in a separate process). It features multiple tabs. That's it.

It doesn't do: syntax highlighting; code folding; project explorer; file explorer; debug / breakpoints; indent / dedent; comment / uncomment; line numbers; find / replace; bracket matching; drag-drop file open; autocomplete

Requirements
------------

wx - Available here: http://www.wxpython.org/download.php


Alternatives
------------

Some much better Python IDEs:

PyScripter (my favourite): https://github.com/pyscripter/pyscripter
IEP: http://www.iep-project.org/
Dr Python (also built in wxpython):http://drpython.sourceforge.net/
